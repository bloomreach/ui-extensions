## How does the UI Extension work?

From the Bloomreach Channel Manager menu, the sitemorse page tool can be opened. In the tools side panel, the extension then analyzes the current page for issues on topics such as SEO and Compliance. The results are then displayed in the Sitemorse extension and from there the user can navigate to the Sitemorse dashboard for more detailed reports.

## Requirements
- A BloomReach Experience Manager (brXM) project running on version 13.3.0 or above.
- An account id from Sitemorse.
- Access to a REST endpoint that runs the Sitemorse SCI client.
